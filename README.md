You should have received an email invitation to access this assigment in
Github Classroom. If you haven't received it, please [post an

The goal of this challenge is to synthesize what you have learned about
R and DADA2 to generate a phyloseq object from the map file and the
demultiplexed FASTQs that you generated in Challenge 5. You will find
this [overview of the DADA2
pipeline](https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/IBIEM/IBIEM_2018_2019/blob/master/content/lessons/dada2_pipeline_toc.md)
very helpful in completing this assignment.

You will need to:

1.  Initialize a new project in RStudio based on this repository (you
    might want to review the [relevant instructions from Challenge
    1](https://github.com/IBIEM/challenge_1/blob/master/README.Rmd#initialize-a-new-project))

2.  Fill the blank R code chunks in
    [challenge6\_assignment.Rmd](challenge6_assignment.Rmd)

3.  Modify the header of
    [challenge6\_assignment.Rmd](challenge6_assignment.Rmd) (you might
    want to review the [relevant instructions from Challenge
    1](https://github.com/IBIEM/challenge_1/blob/master/README.Rmd#modify-the-header)

4.  Submit the Assignment (you might want to review the [relevant
    instructions from Challenge
    1](https://github.com/IBIEM/challenge_1/blob/master/README.Rmd#submitting-the-assignment)
    ). You should submit the following:

-   `challenge6_assignment.Rmd` : your modified version of the R
    Notebook that you received in your repo
-   `challenge6_assignment.html` : the output from knitting your revised
    `challenge6_assignment.Rmd`

1.  Optional (but *strongly* recommended): frequently commit changes and
    push to GitHub.

We strongly recommend that you start working on this immediately so you
will have time to get any help that you need. If you have questions
about this assignment outside of class, please [post an
Issue](https://github.com/IBIEM/community/issues) to the discussion
forum.

Grading

For this assignment and future assignments we will be checking for:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Weight (%)</th>
<th>Component</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>70</td>
<td>Correct Result</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Git Commit Message Quality

-   For some helpful hints [search the internet for "writing good commit
    messages"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=writing+good+commit+messages)
-   You may also want [examples of what not to
    do](https://xkcd.com/1296/)

### SessionInfo

Including a `SessionInfo` statement at the end of your R Notebook is
good reproducibility practice.
